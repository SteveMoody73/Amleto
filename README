**Amleto development has been stopped**
As I no longer use Lightwave regularly and have moved on to other personal projects i will no longer be working on Amleto. I won't be updating it to support Lightwave 2018 but if anybody wants to try adding support i will help out where i can. Latest code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/SteveMoody73/Amleto)

### _**Lightwave 2018 is not supported. Last supported version is 2015**_

## Amleto. A Lightwave 3d Network rendering controller

Amleto is a network rendering tool that enables to render Lightwave animations or single frames across multiple computers. It is intended to be as simple to use and setup as possible. You do not need to know much about networks, instead we use our own file transfer protocol to share files between the computers.

**Easy to install and setup**

No configuration needed. Just install the client software on each computer you wish to render on. The server will be automatically detected and the Lightwave files needed to be able to render will be installed on the pc for you.

**Image preview**

Easy preview of your images as soon as they have been rendered by the client.

**Split image render**

A single image can be split into segments and rendered across any clients connected to speed up the rendering of still images.

**Easy to use**

Easy to add new scenes and manage scenes in the render queue

**Web interface**

Allows you to access Amleto server from anywhere via a web browser.

Adjust Render parameters

Allows you to change the render settings of the scene without having to reload the scene in Lightwave.
